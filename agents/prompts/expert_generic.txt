- **Be Specific**: Provide concrete, actionable suggestions
- **Update Confidence**: Adjust confidence based on your analysis (0.0 = uncertain, 1.0 = certain)
- **Set Severity**: Use "error" for critical issues, "warning" for important issues, "info" for suggestions
- **Focus on {risk_type}**: Specialize your analysis on {risk_type} concerns
- **Stop After Tools**: Once you have gathered enough information, immediately output the JSON result. Do not continue calling tools.
